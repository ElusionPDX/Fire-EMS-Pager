# Inferno Collection: Fire/EMS Pager + Fire Siren
Public Beta Version

The Fire/EMS Pager + Fire Siren is a resource that allows players to have a pager on their person at all times. The pager is off by default, and must be tuned to tones in order to be paged. Once paged, all pagers that are turned on will receive the tone, if a player is tuned to one of the tones that is paged, they will hear a vibration sound, and a notification will pop-up on screen informing them of the call time; if a player is not tuned to a paged tone, they will hear the tone sound, but not hear a vibration, or receive a notification.

The fire siren allows a siren to be sounded at any of the fire stations around the map ([custom stations for the fire siren](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Fire-EMS-Pager/wiki/Adding-custom-stations), and [tones for the pager](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Fire-EMS-Pager/wiki/Adding-custom-tones) can also be added to the resource). Once sounded, a siren can be heard within a predefined radius, and the further from the origin of the siren, the quieter the siren will become.

In the case of the pager, multiple tones can be tuned to, and paged at once, for the fire siren, multiple stations can be sounded at once as well. Once tones are being paged, or a siren sound, they must finish before more are paged or sounded, as tones cannot be paged over other tones, and sirens cannot be played over other sirens (note however, sirens can be sounded at the same time as tones paged, and vice versa).

The Fire/EMS Pager + Fire Siren resource is not only designed to be as effictant and lightweight as possible, but also to be customisable to allow server owners to have as much control as possible over the resource, without the need to edit any code (with the exception of the configuration).

Presently, the following can be customised:
- [Tones](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Fire-EMS-Pager/wiki/Adding-custom-tones)
- [Stations](https://github.com/inferno-collection/Fire-EMS-Pager/wiki/Adding-custom-stations)
- Radius fire siren can be heard in
- Wait time between tones played
